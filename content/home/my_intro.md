The Economic Evaluation Research Group (EERG) is located in the Department of
Health Policy and Management at the University of Georgia. We provide an infrastructure to conduct economic evaluations, quantitative and qualitative analyses of health policies, chronic disease  modeling, and evaluations of public health interventions and programs. 

The EERG brings together a multi-disciplinary team of experts to provide the methods necessary to conduct research relevant for informing health policy making in the state and nationally.

The primary purpose of EERG at UGA is to produce four main products: economic evaluations, health policy analyses, chronic disease decision modeling, and public health program evaluations. These assessments and evaluations focus primarily on local- and state-level policies and programs to provide timely and important information for policy and other decision makers in the state of Georgia. Additionally, assessments and evaluations by EERG focus on important national policies and programs. Thus, EERG can play an important role in advocating for the improvement of population-level health at the local, state, and national levels. The secondary purpose of the EERG is to provide linkages of key faculty and staff with expertise to conduct economic evaluations, quantitative and qualitative health policy analysis, chronic disease decision modeling, and public health program evaluation for the purposes of obtaining research funding to produce scholarly outputs that will ultimately improve population-level health.
