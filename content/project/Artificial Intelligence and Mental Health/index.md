In this project, we are 1) assessing mental health issues facing college students, and 2) evaluating the impact of an artificial intelligence tool designed to support the mental health of college students. This is randomized controlled trial. The findings will provide information about the effects of offering mental health support to students via an artificial intelligence platform.
