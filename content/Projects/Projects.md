## **Artificial Intelligence and Mental Health**

In this project, we are 1) assessing mental health issues facing college students, and 2) evaluating the impact of an artificial intelligence tool designed to support the mental health of college students. This is randomized controlled trial. The findings will provide information about the effects of offering mental health support to students via an artificial intelligence platform.

## **Childhood Obesity**

## **Community Health Promoters Program**

In this project, we are conducting an economic evaluation of the Community Health Promoter (CHP) Program in Puerto Rico considering wider health-related activities to develop a business case for the sustainability and expansion of the program. The CHP Program is attempting to strengthen a communityâ€™s capacity to provide home and health center-based care for chronic care management, navigating social determinants of health and mental health, as well as disaster preparedness and resilience strategies for high-risk populations

## **Health Coaching Interventions**

## **Local Modeling**

## **Pandemic Burden**

## **Prevalence of Vitamin D Deficiency**

Pregnant women are at risk of Vitamin D deficiency, which can lead to Rickets and other bone diseases as well as death in infancy and early childhood due to hypocalcemic cardiomyopathy. The national prevalence of Rickets remains unknown. However, racial and ethnic minorities are at increased rates of rickets and other Vitamin D deficiency conditions. Additionally, preterm birth is associated with Vitamin D deficiency and occurs in higher rates among minority populations. The goal of the current study is to assess the prevalence of cord blood Vitamin D deficiency and to identify differences across racial/ethnic minorities and preterm births. This study can help inform Vitamin D policies during the pregnancy period to optimize offspring health. The project PI is Dr. Sina Gallo.

## **Reducing Urban-Rural Cardiovascular Disease**

Rural populations have higher rates of mortality, prevalence, and economic burden of cardiovascular conditions compared to urban populations. The project goal is to reduce rural-urban disparities in cardiovascular disease by identifying effective clinical and public health interventions that can narrow these gaps in Georgia and New York.

## **ROI on Mental Health Reform**

The researchers at EERG are assessing the cost of Behavioral Mental Health (BMH) among children and adolescents in the state of Georgia. Findings from this assessment will inform state policymakers on the cost-saving potential of BMH reform and intervention

## **Shape Evaluation**
