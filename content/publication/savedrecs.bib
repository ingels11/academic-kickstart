Abstract = {{Background: Obesity has become a global epidemic, with substantial
   impacts on children's health. Numerous intervention studies for the
   prevention of obesity in children have been conducted during the most
   recent decade, but very few have evaluated the long-term and sustainable
   effectiveness of such prevention efforts.
   Methods: We conducted a follow-up study during September 2015 and
   September 2017, based upon a previous 3-year cluster
   randomized-controlled study (RCT) for a comprehensive childhood-obesity
   intervention in 14 primary schools in Shanghai, China. A total of 929
   students were enrolled in the study. Generalized estimating equation
   approaches were applied to analyse student's body mass index (BMI), BMI
   z-score at baseline and three annual long-term follow-ups.
   Results: Three years after the end of the RCT study, the odds of
   developing obesity and the odds of developing obesity or overweight in
   the intervention group were both lower than in the control group among
   girls {[}OR(obesity)= 0.299, p= 0.010 and OR (overweight/obesity) 0.493,
   p 0.013]; the odds of developing obesity or overweight in the
   intervention group was lower than in the control group among boys (OR =
   0.369, p= 0.017). Compared with the baseline, the BMI z-scores in the
   intervention group were lower than those in the control group for both
   normal-weight students (-0.027) and overweight or obese students
   (-0.074).
   Conclusions: The 3-year RCT showed significant and reliable long-term
   effects on preventing childhood obesity, particularly among girls.}},

Abstract = {{Telestroke is a telemedicine intervention that facilitates communication
   between stroke centers and lower-resourced facilities to optimize acute
   stroke management. Using administrative claims data, we assessed trends
   in telestroke use among fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries with
   acute ischemic stroke and the association between providing telestroke
   services and intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV tPA) and
   mechanical thrombectomy use, mortality, and medical expenditures, by
   urban versus rural county of residence in the period 2008-15. The
   proportion of ischemic stroke cases receiving telestroke increased from
   0.4 to 3.8 per 1,000 cases, with usage highest among younger, male,
   non-Hispanic white, and patients in rural or super rural areas (super
   rural is the bottom quartile of rural areas. Compared with patients
   receiving usual care, those receiving telestroke had greater IV tPA and
   mechanical thrombectomy use regardless of county type, while those in
   super rural counties had lower thirty-day all-cause mortality. Despite
   increased telestroke use, rural patients remained less likely than urban
   patients to receive N tPA. The findings suggest that telestroke service
   expansion efforts have increased, especially in rural and super rural
   counties, and have improved outcomes.}},

Title = {{Assessing the role of access and price on the consumption of fruits and
   vegetables across New York City using agent-based modeling}},
Journal = {{PREVENTIVE MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{106}},
Pages = {{73-78}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Most residents in New York City (NYC) do not consume sufficient fruits
   and vegetables every day. Difficulties with access and high prices of
   fruits and vegetables in some neighborhoods contribute to different
   consumption patterns across NYC neighborhoods. We developed an
   agent-based model (ABM) to predict dietary behaviors of individuals at
   the borough and neighborhood levels. Model parameters were estimated
   from the 2014 NYC Community Health Survey, United States Census data,
   and the literature. We simulated six hypothetical interventions designed
   to improve access and reduce the price of fruits and vegetables. We
   found that all interventions would lead to increases in fruit and
   vegetable consumption but the results vary substantially across boroughs
   and neighborhoods. For example, a 10\% increase in the number of
   fruit/vegetable vendors combined with a 10\% decrease in the prices of
   fruits and vegetables would lead to a median increase of 2.28\% (range:
   0.65\%-4.92\%) in the consumption of fruits and vegetables, depending on
   neighborhood. We also found that the impact of increasing the number of
   vendors on fruit/vegetable consumption is more pronounced in unhealthier
   local food environments while the impact of reducing prices on
   fruits/vegetable consumption is more pronounced in neighborhoods with
   low levels of education. An agent-based model of dietary behaviors that
   takes into account neighborhood context has the potential to inform how
   fruit/vegetable access and pricing strategies may specifically work in
   tandem to increase the consumption of fruits and vegetables at the local
   level.}},

Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{827-835}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Obesity is a risk for certain types of cancer; however, awareness of
   obesity as a risk factor for cancer is low. This study evaluated
   increases in cancer risk awareness, including obesity as a risk factor
   for cancer, from a quasi-experimental intervention that provided
   educational materials and community reinforcement for healthy living.
   The study uses data on participant's awareness of cancer risk factors
   along with sociodemographic variables collected from in-person surveys
   (N = 863) at baseline (June 2011) and post intervention (June 2012). The
   average awareness that overweight and obesity are risk factors for
   cancer was low (35 \%) compared to chewing tobacco (92 \%), using
   tanning bed (73 \%), and sunburn (97 \%) at baseline. The intervention
   significantly increased participants' awareness that overweight and
   obesity are risk factors for cancer. Based on regression analysis, the
   unadjusted intervention effect on cancer risk awareness was significant:
   0.392 +/- 0.165 (p value = 0.020) for matched participants and 0.282 +/-
   0.125 (p value = 0.024) for community participants. The adjusted
   intervention effect was significant in the matched participants (0.528
   +/- 0.189, p value = 0.006). Education, income, gender, and age had a
   significant impact on cancer risk awareness for the community
   participants. The results show that community intervention that
   incorporates community reinforcement can have the desired effect
   regardless of differences at participant level. Such interventions could
   be used to prevent cancer risk in communities that are at high risk.}},

Title = {{Preventive Dental Checkups and Their Association With Access to Usual
   Source of Care Among Rural and Urban Adult Residents}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF RURAL HEALTH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{419-426}},
Month = {{FAL}},
Abstract = {{PurposeThis study aimed to assess the relationship between rural or
   urban residence and having a usual source of care (USC), and the
   utilization of preventive dental checkups among adults.
   MethodsCross-sectional analysis was conducted using data from the
   Medical Expenditure Panel Survey 2012. We performed a logit regression
   on the relationship between rural and urban residence, having a USC, and
   having at least 1 dental checkup in the past year, adjusting for
   sociodemographic characteristics and health status.
   FindingsAfter controlling for covariates, rural adult residents had
   significantly lower odds of having at least 1 dental checkup per year
   compared to their urban counterparts (odds ratio {[}OR] = 0.73, 95\%
   confidence interval {[}CI]: 0.62-0.86, P < .001). Additionally,
   individuals with a USC had higher odds of having at least 1 dental
   checkup per year (OR = 1.76, 95\% CI: 1.59-1.95, P < .001). Among both
   rural and urban residents, having a USC was significantly associated
   with an 11\% (95\% CI = 9\%-13\%) increase in the probability of having
   a preventive dental checkup within a year.
   ConclusionsIndividuals with a USC were more likely to obtain a
   preventive dental visit, with similar effects in rural and urban
   settings. We attributed the lower odds of having a checkup in rural
   regions to the lower density of oral health care providers in these
   areas. Integration of rural oral health care into primary care may help
   mitigate the challenges due to a shortage of oral health care providers
   in rural areas.}},

Abstract = {{This paper estimates the relationship between green space and body mass
   index (BMI) in the U.S. We find that accounting for the heterogeneity of
   green space matters: BMI is significantly lower in counties with larger
   forest land per-capita, but not in those more abundant in rangeland,
   pastureland or cropland. This is after controlling for state-specific
   heterogeneity, and a range of environmental and natural amenities,
   including the presence of state parks, proximity to national parks, and
   outdoor recreation resources in the county, all of which have the
   expected negative correlation with BMI. Hence, the findings suggest that
   forests, public recreation lands, along with publicly available outdoor
   recreation resources can be valuable resources to help reduce obesity
   and associated public health problems. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights
