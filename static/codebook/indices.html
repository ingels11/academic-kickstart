<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Risk Seeking Behavior</h2>
<p>The survey question leading to this index asked about 7 different potentially risky behaviors in the following manner (with a list of possible responses):</p>
<p>Please indicate whether the following statements are true for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Always true for me (1)</li>
<li>Sometimes true for me (2)</li>
<li>Rarely true for me (3)</li>
<li>Never true for me (4)</li>
<li>Not Applicable</li>
</ul>
<p>The numbers in parentheses correspond the value given each response in index creation (see below).</p>
<p>The following behaviors were asked about:</p>
<ul>
<li>I wear my seatbelt</li>
<li>I wear a healmet when I ride a bike or motorcycle</li>
<li>I wear sunscreen when outside for &gt;30 minutes</li>
<li>I avoid tanning beds</li>
<li>I don’t text while driving</li>
<li>I don’t drive after having more than 2 alcoholic drinks</li>
<li>I don’t ride with a driver who has been drinking</li>
</ul>
<p>The following figure shows the distribution of responses to these questions. Respondents were most likley to resond “Not Applicable” to the questions about wearing a helmet, driving after drinking, and using tanning beds. Few responded with “Not Applicable” for wearing a seatbelt. Caution should be taken when comparing questions across the always to never true response levels with “Not Applicable” included.</p>

Figure 4.1: Distribution of risk seeking behavior questions
</p>
</div>
<p>The following figure shows the distribution of responses to the risk seeking behavior questions, excluding the “Not Applicable” response and by percentage rather than count. The percentages respond to the distribution across the four levels of response within each question. This allows for a fairer comparison of responses without the “Not Applicable” responses included. The “Always true for me” response made up at least 75% of all responses for all quesitons other than using sunscreen and wearing a helmet. Respondents were significantly more likely to never, rarely, or sometimes wear sunscreen, relative to the other qeustions. As a result, this question has the greatest contribution to variation in the risk seeking behavior index.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.1</span> Index Creation</h3>
<p>To create the risk seeking behavior index across the seven questions, any responses of “Not Applicable” were excluded from index creation. The remaining responses for each survey respondent were averaged together. The value given to responses varied from 1 for “Always true for me” to 4 for “Never true for me.” Therefore, possible index values varied between a minimum of 1.0 and a maximum of 4.0. An index value was not created for any survey respondent with more than 3 missing values (i.e. survey respondents must have a value for at least half of the seven risk seeking behavior questions). Therefore, the number of questions contributing to index creation could vary by respodnent from four to seven questions. The number (% of all survey respondents) of individuals without a risk seeking behavior index is 260 (10.4%).</p>
<p>The following figure shows the distribution of these index values.</p>

The following figure shows the distribution of this variable, including percentages of respondents with each value of the ordinal index.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Patient and Doctor Interaction</h2>
<p>The survey quesiton leading to this index asked about sixteen different patient-doctor interactions in the following manner (with a list of possible responses):</p>
<p>Please consider your most recent interaction with a doctor and indicate whether you agree or disagree with the following statements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strongly agree (-2)</li>
<li>Agree (-1)</li>
<li>Neither agree or disagree (0)</li>
<li>Disagree (1)</li>

<p>Most questions were asked about with a negative construction where “Strongly disagree” would correspond to the most positive interaction. However, several questions has the value reversed (Yes in the above table) as the patient-doctor interaction was constructed in a positive rather than negative manner and “Strongly agree” would correspond to the most positive interaction.</p>
<p>Two indices were created using these questions. First, the PDIS index is based on a previously published set of questions. Second, the critical index is based on one question from the PDIS set of questions along with four other questions added to this survey. The table above indicates which questions were used in the construction of each index.</p>

</div>
<p>Respondents skewed toward agreement with the positively constructed patient-doctor interaction questions (“Reversed” is equal to Yes in table above). This means a skew toward a value of 2 when the index is constructed. The question that is the closest to not following this trend regards the value that a doctor gives toward the patient health and well-being relative to his or her own financial interests.</p>

<p>The questions containing the word “critical” (primarily used to create the critical index) were negatively constructed and similar to other patient-doctor interaction questions skew toward disagreement. The question closest to not following this trend regards smoking, to which respondents wer emost likely to agree with the assertion that a doctor is critical of their smoking behavior.</p>
<div id="indices-pdis-index" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.1</span> Index Creation</h3>
<p>To create the PDIS index, any responses of “Not Applicable” were excluded from index creation. The remaining responses for each survey respondent were averaged together. For the eleven questions used to create the PDIS index, see the table above. The value given to responses varied from -2 to 2 (again see the information above), where -2 corresponds to a very negative interaction and 2 a very positive interaction. Therefore, possible index values varied between a minimum of -2.0 and a maximum of 2.0. An index value was not created for any survey respondent with more than 5 missing values (i.e. survey respondents must have a value for at least half of the eleven PDIS index questions). Therefore, the number of questions contributing to index creation could vary by respodnent from six to eleven questions. The number (% of all survey respondents) of individuals without a risk seeking behavior index is 116 (4.63%).</p>
<p>To create the critical index, a similar procedure was followed using the five questions indicated in the table above. An index value was not created for any survey respondent with more than 2 missing values. Therefore, the number of questions contributing to index creation could vary by respodnent from three to five questions. The number (% of all survey respondents) of individuals without a risk seeking behavior index is 477 (19%).</p>
<p>The following figure shows the distribution of the PDIS index. An interpretation of this index is that more positive values indicate more positive patient-doctor interactions overall and more negative values indicate more negative patient-doctor interactions overall. The closer the index is to zero, the more neutral (neither negative nor positive is the patient-doctor interaction overall).</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Health Care Seeking Behavior</h2>
<p>The survey quesiton leading to this index asked about fifteen different health conditions in the following manner (with a list of possible responses):</p>
<p>Please indicate how likely you would be to call a healthcare provider for an appointment if you experienced the following symptoms:</p>
<ul>
<li>I would call for an appointment immediately (immediate, 5)</li>
<li>I would wait a day or two to see if the symptoms went away before calling (day, 4)</li>
<li>I would wait about a week to see if the symptom went away before calling (week, 3)</li>
<li>I would wait a few weeks to see if the symptoms went away before calling (month, 2)</li>
<li>I would not call a health care provider (never, 1)</li>
</ul>
<p>In the list above, a short name is provided in parentheses along with the value assigned to that response.</p>
<p>The following table summarizes the health conditions included for this part.

<p>The goal of the health condition classification process was to define respondents as individuals who tend to call a health care provider for most conditions and those who do not tend to call for any condition along with those that escalate from not calling for some conditions to immediately calling for some conditions. With fifteen conditions this task is difficult as individuals may flucuate in their responses to some conditions and may have some differences in how they order conditions. However, there is likely to be groupings of conditions that are typically considered less immediate for most individuals are some that are more immediate for most individuals. The above figure indicates that <em>sight</em> and <em>conscious</em> are likely to be considered immediate issues by at least 50% of respondents while the six conditions at the bottom of the figure (<em>sleep</em> up to <em>fever</em>) will be considered less immediate by most respondents.</p>
<p>To further aid in classification, the following plot shows the correlation of responses across all conditions, where conditions are reversed from the way they are ordered in the above figure.</p>

<p>Based on this figure, some clear clustering of variables emerges. The average response to sets of these variables, creates a more limited set of responses for health care seeking behavior. The following levels were created.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Level</th>
<th>Conditions</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>L1</td>
<td>sight, conscious, chest, arm</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>L2</td>
<td>lump, urine, stool</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>L3</td>
<td>fever, throat, cough, diarrhea, sleep</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Several health conditions were not included due to poor correlation with other sets of variables: <em>thoughts</em>, <em>mole</em>, and <em>interest</em>. While <em>interest</em> and <em>thoughts</em> did have a reasonably high correlation with one another, the two conditions differed quite a bit on mean and the quartiles. The values for these levels were created based on the mean of the responses for the associated conditions (removing any missing values).</p>

<p>Next, all respondents can be classified based on whether or not his or her average response stays relatively the same from Level 1 to Level 2 and from Level 2 to Level 3 or increases or decreases between these levels. This classification is given a value of 0 for no change, -1 for a decrease in the response, and a +1 for an increase in the response between levels. Further, these classifications are given as X/Y where X refers to the change from Level 1 to Level 2 and Y refers to the change from Level 2 to Level 3. The following figure shows the distribution of respondents within these categories.</p>

<p>Based on an analysis of suvery responses, these questions were grouped into three levels based on the average response and correlation among responses. Next, all respondents can be classified based on whether or not his or her average response stays relatively the same from Level 1 to Level 2 and from Level 2 to Level 3 or increases or decreases between these levels. Most respondents have either a 0 (no change by level) and/or a -1 (changes in the direction expected). A 1 would indicate a respondent gives higher immediacy to Level 2 relative to Level 1 or to Level 3 relative to Level 2 (counter to most respondents). Any individual with a 1 in either position is put into the health care seeking behavior index category of “Other.” The following table shows how these categorical changes were used to create the final index cagtegories. Starts Medium was once split between constant and escalates but has been merged into a single category.</p>

<p>The following figure shows the distribution of respondents across the health care seeking behavior index categories. Few individuals start low and stay low but the trajectories look so different from those that start but increase to high at higher levels that they probably shoudl be categorized separately. The “Other” category includes a variety of starting levels and often decrease in a way that is different from the typical respondent and there is little similarity among these respondents.</p>

<p>The following set of figures takes a random sample of 30 respondents classified within each health care seeking behavior index category. The mean response for each of the three levels of questions is then plotted to show the general trend including where indiviudals tend to start (Level 3) where they end (Level 1) and what changes occur in between.</p>
